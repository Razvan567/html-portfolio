<h1>The best movies according to Razvan</h1>
<h2>I am mostly into armed combat, war themed and medieval types of movies.</h2>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Tankers</h3>
<p>
  I chose this movie because i like seeing strategies<br />
  of the soviet and germanarmy(1939-1945) and i also like <br />
  tanks a lot.
</p>
<h3>2. Nothing new on the western front</h3>
<p>
  I like this movie because it shows the real side<br />
  of the war or better afragment of how war was <br />
  during the first world war.
</p>
<h3>3. Downfall</h3>
<p>
  I like this movie because they show the end of the <br />
  tyrant we all now about,even though i know how the war<br />
  ended and i know how Hitler died it is interesting to see <br />
  how he panicked and stressed himself when he knew he could<br />
  do nothing to stop the allies from saving the world.
